/*Practice exercise 1.4
Adding comments:
1. Add a new statement to your JavaScript code by setting a variable value.
Since we will cover this in the next chapter, you can use the following line:
let a = 10;
2. Add a comment at the end of the statement indicating that you set a value of
10.
3. Print the value using console.log(). Add a comment explaining what this
will do.
4. At the end of your JavaScript code, use a multiple-line comment. In a real
production script, you might use this space to add a brief outline of the
purpose of the file.*/
